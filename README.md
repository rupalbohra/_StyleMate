# _StyleMate

## Code for the project is in master branch

StyleMate is an online outfit curator that helps people get dresses as per their latest fashion. 


How does it work?
1. Feature #1
One can upload any picture of an outfit they like and StyleMate would show what products are there in the image. This feature is still in progress as it cannot classify the color of the product yet. We are using Google Vision API for this feature.

2. Feature #2
A user needs to enter a part of their existing wardrobe and they'll get related outfits and product links for the same. For example, if you enter "Black Tshirt Outfits", you will get a bunch of outfits that contain black tshirt, you can select the outfit you like and get shopping links for the same.
